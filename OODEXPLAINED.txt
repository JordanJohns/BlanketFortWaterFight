--------------- GameManger.handleShot(Coordinate position) ---------------

    This action is taken after the UserInterface gets the position the player 
chooses to fire. It's purpose is to go through each enemy, check if that 
enemy's fort contains the Coordinate chosen, and if so, changes the letter at
the Coordinate to its lowercase. When a fort is hit, this method also increases
the number of damaged sections that fort has, which decreases the number of 
points it gets for hitting the player each turn. Finally, this method calles the
revealPosition() method to make the GameManger aware that it needs to display 
the Coordinate as already been fired at.
