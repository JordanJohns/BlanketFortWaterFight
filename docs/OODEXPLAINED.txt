--------------- GameManger.handleShot(Coordinate position) ---------------

    This action is taken after the UserInterface gets the position the player 
chooses to fire. It's purpose is to go through each enemy, check if that 
enemy's fort contains the Coordinate chosen, and if so, changes the letter at
the Coordinate to its lowercase. When a fort is hit, this method also increases
the number of damaged sections that fort has, which decreases the number of 
points it gets for hitting the player each turn. Finally, this method calles the
revealPosition() method to make the GameManger aware that it needs to display 
the Coordinate as already been fired at.

How our OOD supports putting a polyomino of letters on the map:

This happens when a Polyomino object is made. Polyomino's constructor is passed a 2-dimensional
character array and a character, which it sets the map and letter fields to. It then calls the
generate method.

generate first calls the findStartingPosition method, which randomly finds and returns an
available position on the map in the form of an object of type Coordinate, which represents
a position on the map. It adds that to the positions field, which is a List of Coordinates.
It puts the letter on the map at the indices given by that Coordinate.

generate then fills the map with the other four blocks of the Polyomino. It does this for each
one by calling the findNewPosition method, which randomly chooses a Coordinate object from
positions, checks each adjacent position, and returns the selected position in the form of a
Coordinate object if it is empty, and null otherwise. If findNewPosition returns a Coordinate,
that is added to positions and the corresponding indices on the map are filled with the letter
field. Otherwise, it calls the removeFromMap method, which uses a stream to set all the indices
of the map represented by the elements in positions to periods, which represent empty spaces,
and removes all elements from positions. This is done because when findNewPosition returns null,
it means that there is no more room in the location chosen to add to the polyomino, meaning
that that polyomino would not have 5 blocks. This algorithm is done in a while loop, so it will
do this same process over again to choose another location to put that polyomino.
